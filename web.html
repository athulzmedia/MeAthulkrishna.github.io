        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree. Alongside my academic journey, I have 
developed a solid understanding of web development. I have gained knowledge in various fundamental concepts and techniques that form the foundation of web development. 
This includes proficiency in HTML,CSS, and  JavaScript, which are crucial languages for creating interactive and visually appealing websites. Additionally, I have also acquired 
practical experience in developingresponsive web layouts, implementing basic functionality, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility. With my grasp of basic web development 
principles, I am excited to further enhance my skills in this dynamic field.
       <p>Through personal projects and hands-on practice, I have honed my abilities in creating user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web interfaces. I am familiar with popular frameworks such as Bootstrap, which facilitate the development process and enable the creation of responsive and mobile-friendly websites. Furthermore, I have gained proficiency in front-end frameworks like React.js, enabling me to build dynamic and interactive web applications. Alongside front-end development, I have also delved into the basics of back-end web development using technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. This has allowed me to develop server-side functionalities and handle data storage and retrieval. With my foundational knowledge and eagerness to learn, I am motivated to continue expanding my skills and exploring the ever-evolving field of web development.
